# fugu-examples

Examples for fugu APIs

# Setup

Please make sure that you should enable `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` at `chrome://flags` and use Chrome over M87.

Most of APIs must be served on https, so you need to make a custom ca for this project. After the run below command, `cert` directory must be created with certificate files

```sh
npm run ca
```
